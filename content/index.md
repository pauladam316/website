Welcome to my website!

I'm Adam, a computer engineer living in Virginia working on building satellite megaconstellations with Lynk Global: https://lynk.world/

My interests encompass all things space, and i've worked on rocket design, spacecraft design, and astrophotography

I'm hoping to use this site to document my astrophotography work, as well as any other technical projects that I'm working on at the time.
